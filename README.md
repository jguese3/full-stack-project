## Project General Description:

This project aims to allow users to keep track of recent game releases, be able to curate their own lists through user log in and be able to view different statistics such as completion rate for a specific video game, user ownership percentage etc. (scope STC)

As a user, I want to be able to view my current backlog of games. So that I can decide which game to play next.

As a user, I want to see what my friends are playing as of late by viewing their "currently playing" list.

As a user, I want to be able to keep track of the latest releases or upcoming games so I could plan ahead or pre-order them.

As a user, I want to view user reviews and ratings for games to determine if I should try it out or buy it.

As a user, I want to be able to view my friends wishlist so that I can get gift ideas for them.
